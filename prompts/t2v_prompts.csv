The streets glisten with reflections of holographic billboards and passing drones.

Slowly, they lean in and share a tender kiss, the camera circling them as droplets fall in slow motion. Electric signs flicker in the background.

Massive gray waves roll beneath a stormy sky, crashing against the bow and sending spray across the deck. The ship pitches and rolls heavily with each swell. Several colorful steel shipping containers on the forward deck shift as the ship lurches; one breaks loose from its lashings and slides toward the port side, tumbling into the sea as a wave slams over the rail. The lighting is dim and overcast, with flashes of white foam and distant lightning illuminating the horizon. The camera occasionally shakes with the impact of the waves."
