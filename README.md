## Homepage

Welcome!

I recently graduated from [METU](https://www.metu.edu.tr/) as an industrial engineer and I am looking for work as a machine learning engineer. I have had over 3 years of part time MLE experience at amazing places that you can find in my [CV](). I also cofounded [METU Artificial Intelligence Society](https://odtuyzt.github.io/#) where we hold seminars, reproduce papers and learn.

I used to be a part of [Bueno](https://bueno.art/), [Global AI Hub](https://globalaihub.com/), [Summarify](https://summarify.io/), [KaVe](https://uzay00.github.io/kahve/) and [CodeFest](https://www.codefesttr.org/).
