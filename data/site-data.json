She is in a seated variation of a backbend leg stretch, resembling a hybrid between Mermaid Pose and Compass Pose (Parivrtta Surya Yantrasana). She sits on the floor with one leg bent beneath her and the other leg extended upward. Her right leg is lifted straight up, with her right foot pointing toward the ceiling. Her right arm reaches behind her head to grasp the lifted foot, pulling it closer, creating a deep stretch along her side body and spine. Her left arm reaches back to hold her left foot (which is bent on the floor), giving additional stability and creating an elegant curve in her torso. Her chest is open, shoulders rolled back, and she maintains an upright spine with a soft smile."
